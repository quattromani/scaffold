#Scaffold

Welcome to Scaffold. Scaffold is here to make your life easier; your code cleaner and more efficient. By starting with maintainable, well-documented CSS, you have a methodology for extending anything you need, and writing new styles that follow specification.

###Version
0.2.1

###Scaffold in a nutshell
At the heart of Scaffold is it's love of truly semantic html -- write good markup, get great results. Scaffold already contains the majority of semantic elements that you will encounter when building a component. Need a "helper" make your component fall in line? You've got it!

###Style Guide / House Style
>A style guide is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization or field. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting within a document and across multiple documents.

A set of standards for a specific organization is often known as "house style". When you see something marked "house style", you'll know that we're speaking specifically to a brand's style.

###Patterns
>A pattern describes an optimal solution to a common problem within a specific context.

Each pattern has four primary components:  
1. a title  
2. a problem  
3. a context  
4. a solution  

You can see what's already a pattern at the [Pattern Library]. Don't be afraid to take an existing pattern and beat it into submission to create something new. Just be sure to name it and document it. Oh! and submit it back to Scaffold so we can share it.

###Web Components
Making the latest Polymer masterpiece? first check out the [Web-Components] section. Don't see what you need? Start by droping a copy of main.min.css (a whopping 43k) into your project folder! Then when you need to add specifics, make a web-component.css file with you additions.

##Usage
In most cases, you just want a copy of main.min.css. So download it and start creating. You can start at the [homepage] to get around Scaffold. Explore a bit and see what we've started with. 

###Install
Download it [directly]  

Install with [Bower]:`bower install -- save scaffold`  

###But why not just use Bootstrap?
We love bootstrap! It served us well for quite sometime. Scaffold looks up to Bootstrap, Scaffold is inspired by Bootstrap, and Scaffold thinks of Bootstrap as a mentor; but the time has come for more efficient and direct css without all the commitments that come with Bootstrap. Scaffold contains minimal styling, basically the branding on predefined elements: Typography, buttons, form fields, etc.


###Scaffold is Built On the Backs of:
* bower
* npm
* grunt
