<h2>Software Development Life Cycle</h2>

<p class="lede">"Clearly defined and distinct work phases which are used to plan for, design, build, test, and deliver information systems."</p>

<ul class="vertical lined">
	<li>
		<h3>Discover</h3>

	</li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>Develop</h3>
    <p>Coding. Test it and repeat until development sins can be forgiven. Write Documentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3><i class="fa fa-refresh fa-lg"></i> Repeat - Iterate - Make Better</h3>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>A refactor, or scrubbing, should occur at the end of each phase to ensure that the final product delivery is not a bloated beast of obfuscated code and <b>'best practices'</b>. That being declared; never sacrifice making something excellent for the sake of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a>.</p>
