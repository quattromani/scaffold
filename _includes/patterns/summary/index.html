<p>Super Cool; the Summary element is a reveal box that can be clicked to show additional information to the user. For browsers that don't support the element, it jsut defaults open - which is not a bad fallback.</p>

<div class="box-column clear">
    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <details closed>
        <summary>Summary</summary>
        <p>If your browser supports the details element, it should allow
        you to expand and collapse this text by clicking the triangle.</p>
    </details>

{% highlight html %}
<details closed>
  <summary>Summary</summary>
  <p>If your browser supports the details element, it should allow
you to expand and collapse this text by clicking the triangle.</p>
</details>
{% endhighlight %}
